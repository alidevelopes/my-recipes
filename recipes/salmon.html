        <h1>Salmon Couscous Salad</h1>

        <img src="../img/salmon.jpg" alt="an image of a mouth-watering salmon">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This salmon couscous salad recipe features salmon, couscous, and arugula salad layered in a bowl and drizzled <br> 
            with homemade pesto dressing for a unique presentation. This dish is a nod to a dish I tried at a local restaurant.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add mayonnaise, buttermilk, pesto, lemon juice, and garlic to the bowl
                of a food processor. Blend until smooth. <br> Season to taste with black pepper. Set dressing 
                aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Season salmon with Greek
                 seasoning. Cut salmon into two filets. <br>Melt butter in a skillet over medium 
                 heat and add olive oil. Place salmon, skin side down, in the hot skillet. <br> 
                 Cook until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir couscous into 
                the water. Cover saucepan and let <br>stand until water is absorbed completely, 
                about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, place salad mixture into 2 dinner bowls, and sprinkle chopped 
                tomatoes over the salad. <br>Fluff couscous with a fork. Mound couscous in the 
                center of each bowl. <br>Sprinkle Parmesan cheese around couscous. Place a salmon
                 filet to the side of the couscous. Pour 1 to 2 <br>tablespoons pesto dressing on 
                 top of dish. Sprinkle with pepitas. Serve immediately.
