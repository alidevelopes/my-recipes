# my-recipes
My very first basic-html project!

Creating a basic recipe website, containing a main index page which will have links to few recipes.

The aim:
    - test and demonstrate my basic understanding of html (e.g. boilerplate, tags and other elements).
    - test and demonstrate basic understanding of git (creating and cloning a repository to local machine, git-workflow: modifying, staging and committing, and pushing it to github)



Reflection:
    - It wasn't that challenging to create this recipe project since it required only basic understanding of html.
    - However, i did learn about nesting list, i.e. creating lists within lists.
    - Also i got to practice and get comfortable with basic html tags and elements. 
    - Looking forward to making it even better by styling it with CSS. 

    -Git part:
        - I also got to practice and put my basic understanding of git workflow to the test. 
        - I still am not comfortable working with it (yet!), because of commands and directory stuff.
        - Even so, I'm hanging in there, and I think learning git would pretty handy (obviously).

    
    All in all, after completion of this project, i feel motivated!
